# 👤 About Me

Dang, you really wanna know huh?

 I’m **Sean Njela**, **DevOpsSean**. I'm a developer, engineer, and lifelong learner documenting my personal and professional projects.

This site serves as a **central hub for my technical work**, built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and organized to reflect real-world implementations, lessons learned, and ongoing exploration in areas like DevOps, infrastructure, automation, and system design.

## 🎯 Why This Exists

This documentation is part of an ongoing effort to:

- Capture complex project setups in a reusable, referenceable format
- Practice clear technical communication
- Save future-me from future-headaches
- Share knowledge with others who might stumble across this work

Whether you're here to learn, debug, borrow ideas, or just browse, you're welcome.

## 🧰 Tools and Tech I Often Work With

Some of the technologies you'll find across these projects:

- Containers: Docker, Kubernetes, Kind
- Infrastructure: Terraform, Helm, Devbox
- Automation: Taskfile, Make, CI/CD workflows
- Docs: MkDocs, markdown, GitHub Pages
- Languages: Python, Bash, YAML

> This stack evolves as I experiment and learn — not every project will use everything.
