# 🧱 System Architecture Overview

This section provides a high-level overview of the architecture and design decisions behind the project. It outlines the system's core components, their responsibilities, and how they interact.

Normally applications are secure at the perimeter of the network. This can cause issues when an application is compromised, as the attacker can access the entire network by moving laterally.

## 📐 Design Philosophy

Summarize your approach or values. Examples:

- Modular and composable
- Secure by default
- Automation-first (e.g., IaC, CI/CD)
- Portable/local-dev friendly

## 🧩 Core Components

### 1. Infrastructure

- Describe how infrastructure is provisioned (e.g., Terraform, Pulumi)
- Where it's deployed (e.g., local Kind cluster, cloud, etc.)
- Example:
  - **Kind** cluster created via `task dev`
  - **Terraform** used to manage Argo CD and related resources

### 2. CI/CD

- What tools handle deployment?
- Example:
  - **Argo CD** handles Kubernetes app delivery using the **App of Apps** pattern
  - Image updates via **argocd-image-updater**
  - Optional notification layer (e.g., Slack integration)

### 3. Secrets & Configuration

- Mention secret handling (e.g., Sealed Secrets, SOPS, Vault)
- Config management tools (e.g., Helm, Kustomize)

## 🔄 Data / Control Flow

Explain the high-level lifecycle or data flow:

1. User runs `task dev`
2. Terraform provisions resources
3. Argo CD bootstraps itself and deploys other apps
4. Image updater checks container registries and pushes updates
5. Notifications triggered via webhook → Slack
