!!! warning "Important Disclaimer"

    This is a personal documentation site. I am maintaining it solo and cannot guarantee that every issue is fully documented or resolved. If you don’t find a solution here, **don’t panic** — most tools used in this project (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Devbox) are widely adopted and well-supported. Try these resources first:

     1. **ChatGPT or another AI assistant** – Quick answers and guided debugging  
     2. **YouTube** – Visual walkthroughs for complex tools or errors  
     3. **Google** – Forums, GitHub Issues, and StackOverflow posts are often goldmines

## 🧠 Pro Tip

When searching using the search bar above, include the name of the tool or parts of the error message (in quotes if exact), e.g.:

"helm install" or "helm" "chart not found" or "not found"
"terraform apply" or "terraform" "invalid provider configuration" or "provider not found"
"kubectl apply" or "kubectl" "namespace not found" or "namespace does not exist"
